This anonymous repository contains code for the core models and description for the data used in *TUNA: Table Understanding with Number Augmentation*. 

The folders `number_encoder/`  and `number_tokenizer/` contain code for **NumBed** (Sec. 3.1) and **NumTok** (Sec. 3.2), respectively.

The folder `phases/downstream_tasks` contains codes for the downstream models (Sec. 4).

The intermediate pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation code will be released after the review process is completed to facilitate reproducing and further research.
